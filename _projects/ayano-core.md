description: A simple bot created using discord.py.
---

Emilia is a simple Discord bot built off the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper. It currently serves mostly as my testbed for database manipulation, data storage/caching, and user interaction practices. It also contains several utilities for Discord that I personally find useful.

Emilia is currently a heavy WIP, but eventually may be released for public use.
