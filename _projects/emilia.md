description: A Discord bot and web dashboard built using discord.js, Express, and React.
---

Emilia is a Discord bot built using the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) API wrapper. It includes a custom-built command framework, and uses TypeORM with PostgreSQL for user data storage.

To be used with the bot is an administrative web dashboard, built using Bootstrap, Express and React. The currently non-functional homepage can be seen [here](https://emilia.pw).

Both the bot and the website are currently a heavy WIP, but eventually will be released for public use.
